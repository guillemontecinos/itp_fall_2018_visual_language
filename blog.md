## Week 1 - Design Analysis
For the design analysis is chose the cover of "The Man Machine", the 7th album of the German electronic band Kraftwerk (in German, *Die Mensch-Maschine*), released in 1978. Kraftwerk has been recognized for their retro-futuristic aesthetic developed in the mid 70's in a context of a post-war Germany -pulled by the two world antagonistic forces. They were part of the first generations using technology to make non-academic music and made the technology one of their motto.

"The Man Machine" cover was designed by the German artist Günther Fröhling and is strongly influenced by the [Russian Suprematism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprematism) because of the straight lines that define the system -which is rotated- and the dominant presence of the red and black within the composition. The cover consist in a picture of the four members of Kraftwerk standing in a stairs one ahead the other and looking to their left -the right side of the cover. The design palette of colors moves from red -for the background and the musicians shirts- to black -for text and the musicians ties- and covering also white for the word *Kraftwerk*, skin color for the musicians faces and gray for their pants.

The system used to design the cover -as said before- consists in an orthogonal and rotated grid which defines three main areas: the biggest one hosts the four musicians standing in the stairs, the second biggest space hosts the word *Kraftwerk* and the name of the album *Die Menesch-Maschine* and finally the third space perpendicularly displays the translation of the album name in Russian, English and French.
