## Week 1 - Design Analysis
For the design analysis is chose the cover of "The Man Machine", the 7th album of the German electronic band Kraftwerk (in German, *Die Mensch-Maschine*), released in 1978. Kraftwerk has been recognized for their retro-futuristic aesthetic developed in the mid 70's in a context of a post-war Germany -pulled by the two world antagonistic forces. They were part of the first generations using technology to make non-academic music and made the technology one of their motto.

"The Man Machine" cover was designed by the German artist Günther Fröhling and is strongly influenced by the [Russian Suprematism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprematism) because of the straight lines that define the system -which is rotated- and the dominant presence of the red and black within the composition. The cover consist in a picture of the four members of Kraftwerk standing in a stairs one ahead the other and looking to their left -the right side of the cover. The design palette of colors moves from red -for the background and the musicians shirts- to black -for text and the musicians ties- and covering also white for the word *Kraftwerk*, skin color for the musicians faces and gray for their pants.

The system used to design the cover -as said before- consists in an orthogonal and rotated grid which defines three main areas: the biggest one hosts the four musicians standing in the stairs, the second biggest space hosts the word *Kraftwerk* and the name of the album *Die Menesch-Maschine* and finally the third space perpendicularly displays the translation of the album name in Russian, English and French.

The system defines hierarchy of the elements within the composition. The main space also hosts the negative space of the cover which is corresponds to the red background of the picture and the red shirts of the four musicians. It's fair to ask if the clothes of the persons should be considered positive space because are wore by the main characters of the composition, but it's a design decision to make them fade with the background to remark the human-machine faces.

The designer seeks to bring our attention firstly to the robot-human faces -which are the main characters- but he did it with a playful counterposition of the contrasted red background and the black hair that contour the skin-colored faces. This is the first positive space.

After that, the designer decided to call our attention to the information displayed within the rotated system, written in black and white capital letters. Firstly the attention is attracted by the upper-left side of the cover in where the name *Kraftwerk* is written in a shiny white which clearly evokes the Suprematism before mentioned. In the same section the name of the cover the name of the album is displayed in a black and sharpened font -deliberately chosen to give the title a mechanic and technology aspect-, in which the "M" of "Menesch" is remarked by being double sized respecting the rest of the title. Clearly the use of color in the text seeks to remark in first place the name of the band and in second place the name of the album. Finally
